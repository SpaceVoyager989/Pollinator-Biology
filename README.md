The code calculates the percentage of plants that will be pollinated by different mating systems 
either xenogamous vs. geitonogamous; or in the second case geitonogamous + autogamous vs. xenogamous
The input parameters are the number of plants in population; number of flowers that pollinator visits on one plant;
the initial probability; the probability that pollinator species is in contact with anthers on the flower.

The latter is the main reason I (with help of Chat GPT) wrote the code as I was seeing some bee species (_Anthophora_) very irregulary triggering the anther mechanism in Salvia flowers,
but bumblebees were triggering the anther mechanism all the time. So I was interested how this can effect the whole plant population.

If you are interested open the code, I think it can become more clear.
